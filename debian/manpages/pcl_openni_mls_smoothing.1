.SH NAME
pcl_openni_mls_smoothing \- pcl_openni_mls_smoothing
.SH DESCRIPTION
usage: pcl_openni_mls_smoothing <device_id> <options>

.B "where options are:"

\fB\-search_radius\fR X = sphere radius to be used for finding the k\-nearest neighbors used for fitting (default: 0)

\fB\-sqr_gauss_param\fR X = parameter used for the distance based weighting of neighbors (recommended = search_radius^2) (default: 0)

\fB\-use_polynomial_fit\fR X = decides whether the surface and normal are approximated using a polynomial or only via tangent estimation (default: 0)

\fB\-polynomial_order\fR X = order of the polynomial to be fit (implicitly, use_polynomial_fit = 1) (default: 2)
