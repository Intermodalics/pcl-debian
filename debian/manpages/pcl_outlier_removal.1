.SH DESCRIPTION

Syntax is: pcl_outlier_removal input.pcd output.pcd <options>


Statistical Outlier Removal filtering of a point cloud. For more information, use: pcl_outlier_removal \fB\-h\fR

  where options are:

 \fB\-method\fR X = the outlier removal method to be used (options: radius / statistical) (default: radius)

 \fB\-radius\fR X = (RadiusOutlierRemoval) the sphere radius used for determining the k\-nearest neighbors (default: 0)

 \fB\-min_pts\fR X = (RadiusOutlierRemoval) the minimum number of neighbors that a point needs to have in the given search radius in order to be considered an inlier (default: 0)

 \fB\-mean_k\fR X = (StatisticalOutlierRemoval only) the number of points to use for mean distance estimation (default: 2)

 \fB\-std_dev_mul\fR X = (StatisticalOutlierRemoval only) the standard deviation multiplier threshold (default: 0.000000)

 \fB\-negative\fR X = decides whether the inliers should be returned (1), or the outliers (0). (default: 0)

 \fB\-keep_organized\fR = keep the filtered points in organized format.
