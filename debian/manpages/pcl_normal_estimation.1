.SH NAME
pcl_normal_estimation \- pcl_normal_estimation
.SH DESCRIPTION

Syntax is: pcl_normal_estimation input.pcd output.pcd <options> [optional_arguments]


Estimate surface normals using NormalEstimation. For more information, use: pcl_normal_estimation \fB\-h\fR

  where options are:

 \fB\-radius\fR X = use a radius of Xm around each point to determine the neighborhood (default: 0.000000)

 \fB\-k\fR X = use a fixed number of X\-nearest neighbors around each point (default: 0.000000)

 For organized datasets, an IntegralImageNormalEstimation approach will be used, with the RADIUS given value as SMOOTHING SIZE.


Optional arguments are:

 \fB\-input_dir\fR X  = batch process all PCD files found in input_dir

 \fB\-output_dir\fR X = save the processed files from input_dir in this directory
