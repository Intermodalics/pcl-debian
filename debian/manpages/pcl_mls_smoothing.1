.SH NAME
pcl_mls_smoothing \- pcl_mls_smoothing
.SH DESCRIPTION

Syntax is: pcl_mls_smoothing input.pcd output.pcd <options>


Moving Least Squares smoothing of a point cloud. For more information, use: pcl_mls_smoothing \fB\-h\fR

  where options are:

 \fB\-radius\fR X= sphere radius to be used for finding the k\-nearest neighbors used for fitting (default: 0.000000)

 \fB\-sqr_gauss_param\fR X = parameter used for the distance based weighting of neighbors (recommended = search_radius^2) (default: 0.000000)

 \fB\-use_polynomial_fit\fR X = decides whether the surface and normal are approximated using a polynomial or only via tangent estimation (default: 0)

 \fB\-polynomial_order\fR X = order of the polynomial to be fit (implicitly, use_polynomial_fit = 1) (default: 2)
