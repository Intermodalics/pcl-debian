pcl_extract_feature \- pcl_extract_feature
.SH DESCRIPTION

Syntax is: pcl_extract_feature input.pcd output.pcd <options>


Extract features from a point cloud. For more information, use: pcl_extract_feature \fB\-h\fR

  where options are:

 \fB\-feature\fR X = the feature descriptor algorithm to be used (default: FPFHEstimation)

 \fB\-n_radius\fR X = use a radius of Xm around each point to determine the neighborhood in normal estimation (default: 0.000000)

 \fB\-n_k\fR X = use a fixed number of X\-nearest neighbors around each point in normal estimation (default: 0.000000)

 \fB\-f_radius\fR X = use a radius of Xm around each point to determine the neighborhood in feature extraction (default: 0.000000)

 \fB\-f_k\fR X = use a fixed number of X\-nearest neighbors around each point in feature extraction(default: 0.000000)
