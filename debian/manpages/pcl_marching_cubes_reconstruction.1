.SH NAME
pcl_marching_cubes_reconstruction \- pcl_marching_cubes_reconstruction
.SH DESCRIPTION

Syntax is: pcl_marching_cubes_reconstruction input.pcd output.vtk <options>


Compute the surface reconstruction of a point cloud using the marching cubes algorithm (pcl::surface::MarchingCubesHoppe or pcl::surface::MarchingCubesRBF. For more information, use: pcl_marching_cubes_reconstruction \fB\-h\fR

  where options are:

 \fB\-grid_res\fR X= the resolution of the grid (cubic grid) (default: 50)

 \fB\-iso_level\fR X    = the iso level of the surface to be extracted (default: 0.000000)

 \fB\-hoppe\fR X   = use the Hoppe signed distance function (MarchingCubesHoppe

 \fB\-rbf\fR X= use the RBF signed distance function (MarchingCubesRBF

 \fB\-extend\fR X  = the percentage of the bounding box to extend the grid by (default: 0.000000)

 \fB\-displacement\fR X = the displacement value for the off\-surface points (only for RBF) (default: 0.010000)
