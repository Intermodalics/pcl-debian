pcl_spin_estimation \- pcl_spin_estimation
.SH DESCRIPTION

Syntax is: pcl_spin_estimation input.pcd output.pcd <options>


Estimate spin\-image descriptors using pcl::SpinEstimation. For more information, use: pcl_spin_estimation \fB\-h\fR

  where options are:

 \fB\-radius\fR X= use a radius of Xm around each point to determine the neighborhood (default: 0.000000)

 \fB\-width\fR X = resolution (width) of a spin\-image (default: 8)

 \fB\-suppangle\fR X  = min cosine of support angle for filtering points by normals (default: 0.500000)

 \fB\-neigh\fR X = min number of neighbours to compute a spin\-image (default: 1)

 \fB\-radial\fR   = toggles radial structure of a spin\-image (default: false)

 \fB\-angular\fR  = toggles angular domain of a spin\-image (default: false)
