.SH NAME
pcl_compute_cloud_error \- pcl_compute_cloud_error
.SH DESCRIPTION

Syntax is: pcl_compute_cloud_error source.pcd target.pcd output_intensity.pcd <options>


  where options are:

 \fB\-correspondence\fR X = the way of selecting the corresponding pair in the target cloud for the current point in the source cloud

 options are: index = points with identical indices are paired together. Note: both clouds need to have the same number of points

    nn = source point is paired with its nearest neighbor in the target cloud

    nnplane = source point is paired with its projection on the plane determined by the nearest neighbor in the target cloud. Note: target cloud needs to contain normals
