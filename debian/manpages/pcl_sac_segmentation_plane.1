.SH NAME
pcl_sac_segmentation_plane \- pcl_sac_segmentation_plane
.SH DESCRIPTION

Syntax is: pcl_sac_segmentation_plane input.pcd output.pcd <options> [optional_arguments]


Estimate the largest planar component using SACSegmentation. For more information, use: pcl_sac_segmentation_plane \fB\-h\fR

  where options are:

 \fB\-thresh\fR X = set the inlier threshold from the plane to (default: 0.05)

 \fB\-max_it\fR X = set the maximum number of RANSAC iterations to X (default: 1000)

 \fB\-neg\fR 0/1  = if true (1), instead of the plane, it returns the largest cluster on top of the plane (default: false)


Optional arguments are:

 \fB\-input_dir\fR X  = batch process all PCD files found in input_dir

 \fB\-output_dir\fR X = save the processed files from input_dir in this directory
